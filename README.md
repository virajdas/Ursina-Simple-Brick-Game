# Ursina Simple Brick Game

This is a simple demo of the Ursina library within Python that allows for creating games in the 3d world right in your python editor.

Before downloading the files, type:
```
pip install ursina
```
After this, you may download and run the code (I would try running both .py files because they both do different things).
